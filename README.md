# Learn Go in One-Go

 ### Flashback:
  I ‚ù§Ô∏è Java! It has always been my go to language for any problem.  It is fast, reliable and once  you learn it, it just comes to you! Its awesome! 
 
 For one of my personal projects, I wanted to develop some microservices.  As you might have guessed, I obviously went along with **Spring Boot**.  These applications were containerized and deployed in Google Cloud Run ü§ç.

I didn't have to worry much about the cost, since Google is so generous with the Cloud run free tier,  I deployed several applications to the cloud. I knew it was actually eating quite a lot of ram, but I didn't had to worry much since my friends and I were the only users of this project. So the cost was always under the limit. 

One fine morning, I was scrolling through medium, and I came across this [post](https://medium.com/@dexterdarwich/comparison-between-java-go-and-rust-fdb21bd5fb7c) 

**I was quite amazed to see the performance comparison of Go vs Java.**  

As per the post,  Go wins hands down in  most of the areas. Yes, Java had advantage around computations, but for a containerized application, the artifact size of Go application, was so minimal compared to java. I am not even starting about the memory usage. 

Since then, I wanted to learn Go!!

I found the syntax of Go is really easy to pick up. I guess, I would be having some troubles in the correct usage of pointers, since I am really more of a Java person.

This is my attempt of learning Go and I intend to convert some of my microservices to Go. 
I am quite excited.  I would be starting from the very basic. The documentation available in https://golang.org/ would be a good starting place. Parallelly I would be learning from YouTube as well. I am planning to every project I create in this repository starting from HelloWorld.
